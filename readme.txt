Extensible multi-provider AI chatbot for WordPress and Elementor.

== Description ==

WP DS AI Chatbot provides one secure chatbot renderer for shortcode, global display, and Elementor. It supports OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, OpenRouter, and the provider-agnostic WordPress AI Client on WordPress 7.0 or newer.

API keys remain server-side. Public requests use signed sessions, atomic rate limits, an in-flight session lock, and a configurable rolling 24-hour request budget.

The plugin settings include a live chat preview with shared colors, width, typography, corner radius, global position, and offsets. The same appearance applies to global, shortcode, and Elementor chatbots.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin ZIP through Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin.
2. Activate WP DS AI Chatbot.
3. Open Settings > DS AI Chatbot and select a provider.
4. Configure the provider key through wp-config.php, an environment variable, or the write-only settings field.
5. Add the [ds_ai_chatbot] shortcode, enable global display, or use the Elementor widget.
